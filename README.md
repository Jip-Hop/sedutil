sedutil - The Drive Trust Alliance Self Encrypting Drive Utility

This program and it's accompanying Pre-Boot Authorization image allow
you to enable the locking in SED's that comply with the TCG OPAL 2.00
standard on bios machines.

**Note:** sedutil does not support standby (aka S3, STR, suspend to RAM). If you want to use it on desktop systems where STR was previously used, configure these for hibernation instead.   

See the [wiki](https://github.com/sedutil/sedutil/wiki) for information on how to obtain and use sedutil.
